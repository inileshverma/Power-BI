# Spectra-Tiles-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS PowerBI)
## Project Objective
Spectra Tiles is looking to gain valuable insights into the performance of shows on its streaming platform throughout 2023. The goal is to analyze viewer engagement and identify the top-performing content. This will enable the platform’s owner to better understand consumer preferences and expand the variety of content, ultimately driving subscription growth in 2024 and 2025.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/inileshverma/Power-BI/blob/main/6.2-Spectra_titles.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Titles Available – The total number of movies and TV shows on the platform.
- Total Directors – The count of unique directors contributing to the content library.
- Total Genres Covered – The variety of genres available on the platform.
- Top Performing Genres – The most popular genres based on the number of titles.
- Content Growth Over Time – The increase in the number of movies and TV shows by year.
- Movies vs. TV Shows Ratio – The percentage of movies compared to TV shows.
- Geographical Content Distribution – The number of titles produced per country.
- User Engagement Metrics (if available) – Number of views, watch time, or ratings per title.
- Subscription Growth Correlation – How content variety impacts user subscriptions (2023 vs. previous years).
- Quarterly Content Performance – The number of successful titles released in each quarter.

## Process
- Data Collection – I gathered raw data on movies, TV shows, genres, directors, release years, and country-wise distribution.
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in data formatting.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – I conducted an in-depth analysis to identify key trends in content performance, genre popularity, and content distribution over time.
- Power BI Dashboard Development – I created visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps. I implemented interactive filters (e.g., quarterly selection, genre-based analysis).
- KPI Tracking & Insights – I defined key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure content trends and their impact on audience engagement.
- Final Deployment & Documentation – I finalized the Power BI dashboard and documented key findings for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

## Project Insight
1. Content Growth Trend:
The number of movies and TV shows has significantly increased, especially after 2000, showing rapid content expansion.
2. Genre Popularity:
Drama, Comedy, and Suspense are the most popular genres, indicating audience preference for engaging and emotionally driven content.
3. Country-wise Content Distribution:
Content is spread across multiple regions, with certain countries contributing significantly more than others.
4. Movies vs. TV Shows:
Movies (80.82%) dominate the platform, while TV shows make up a smaller portion (19.18%). This suggests a stronger focus on films over series.
5. Seasonal Performance:
Filtering by quarterly data can help determine which periods see higher content releases, allowing strategic planning for future launches.

## Final Conclusion:
Through this project, I successfully built an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into Spectra Tiles' content performance. The analysis helps in understanding audience preferences, content trends, and areas for strategic improvement.

By leveraging these findings, Spectra Tiles can:
- Optimize content selection based on audience preferences.
- Expand in high-performing genres and regions.
- Improve strategic planning for content releases in 2024 & 2025.
- Drive higher user engagement and subscription growth.
